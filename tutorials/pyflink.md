The base Flink Docker image doesn't come with Python installed by default, as it's primarily designed for Java/Scala applications. Let me walk you through installing Python in your Flink containers.

## Install Python in the existing containers

You can install Python directly in your running containers:

```bash
# Connect to the Flink JobManager container
docker exec -it flink-jobmanager bash

# Update package lists
apt-get update

# Install Python 3 and pip
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

# Create a symbolic link so 'python' command works
ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python

# Verify the installation
python -V
```

You'll need to repeat this for the TaskManager container as well:

```bash
docker exec -it flink-taskmanager bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python
```

Note that these changes will be lost when the containers are removed or recreated.

## Installing PyFlink

If you're planning to use Flink's Python API (PyFlink), you'll also need to install these packages:

```bash
pip3 install apache-flink pandas numpy
```

## Verifying the Installation

After installation, you can verify that Python and PyFlink are working correctly:

```bash
docker exec -it flink-jobmanager bash

# Check Python version
python -V

# Test PyFlink
python -c "from pyflink.datastream import StreamExecutionEnvironment; print('PyFlink is working!')"
```

Remember that for production environments, it's always better to create custom images with all dependencies pre-installed rather than installing packages in running containers. This ensures consistency across deployments and prevents issues that might arise from missing dependencies when containers are restarted.
